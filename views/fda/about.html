  The OpenTrialsFDA team is one of the six finalists for the <a
    href="https://www.openscienceprize.org/" rel="external">Open Science
    Prize</a>. This is a collaboration between Drs. Erick Turner, <a
    href="http://www.badscience.net" rel="external">Ben Goldacre</a> and the
  OpenTrials team at <a href="https://okfn.org" rel="external">Open Knowledge
    International</a>.  The work is closely related to the <a
    href="https://opentrials.net" rel="external">OpenTrials project</a>, which
  aims to locate, match, and share all publicly accessible data and documents,
  on all trials conducted, on all medicines and other treatments, globally.
</p>

<p>
  OpenTrialsFDA works on making clinical trial data from the <a
    href="http://www.fda.gov/" rel="external">FDA</a> (the US Food and Drug
  Administration) more easily accessible and searchable. Until now, this
  information has been hidden in the user-unfriendly Drug Approval Packages that
  the FDA publishes via its dataportal <a
  href="http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/default.htm" rel="external">Drugs@FDA</a>.
  OpenTrialsFDA extracts the relevant data from the FDA documents, link it to
  other clinical trial data and present it through this new user-friendly web
  interface. Any user can type in a drug name, and see all the places where this
  drug is mentioned in an FDA document. Users can also access, search and present
  this information through the application programming interfaces (APIs) the team
  will produce.
</p>

  <h2>Unlocking the trove of FDA clinical trials data</h2>
  <p>
    The FDA Drug Approval Packages report the methods and results of all
    premarketing clinical trials, both published and unpublished. Interestingly,
    the FDA data is unbiased, compared to reports of clinical trials in academic
    journals. This is because FDA reviewers, unlike most academic journal reviewers
    and editors, have access to the original trial protocol and can spot and reject
    any attempts at post hoc changes to planned outcomes and statistical analyses.
    Therefore, a systematic review (SR) or meta-analysis (MA) based on FDA Drug
    Approval Packages, which includes unpublished and “unspun” trial results, will
    often conclude that the drug in question is less safe and/or less effective
    than what one would conclude from a conventional SR or MA based solely on the
    published literature.
  </p>

  <p>
    Unfortunately, despite their high value, these FDA documents are notoriously
    difficult to access, aggregate, and search. The Drugs@FDA website itself is not
    intuitive to navigate, and the reviews are stored as individual PDFs which,
    except for relatively new drugs, cannot be searched. As a consequence, they are
    rarely used by clinicians and researchers. OpenTrialsFDA will improve this
    situation, so that valuable information that is currently hidden away can be
    discovered, presented, and used to properly inform evidence-based treatment
    decisions.

  <h2>The OpenTrialsFDA prototype</h2>
  <p>
    The team has scraped the FDA website and extracted the relevant information
    from the PDFs through a process of OCR (optical character recognition). Through
    this new OpenTrialsFDA interface, users will be able to explore and discover
    the FDA data. In addition, the information will be integrated into the
    OpenTrials database, so that the FDA report can be linked to reports from other
    sources, such as ClinicalTrials.gov, EU CTR, HRA, WHO ICTRP, and PubMed.
    The six finalists of the Open Science Prize will showcase their prototypes at
    the <a href="http://event.capconcorp.com/wp/bd2k-odss/" rel="external">BD2K
      Open Data Science Symposium</a> on 1 December 2016, when public voting
    will begin. The public is asked to help select the most promising, innovative
    and impactful prototype from among the six finalists - of which one will
    receive the grand prize of $230,000.
